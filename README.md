# Cl√©ment's CV

## Overview

I was too lazy to update my CV. Here's a dynamically generated version in pure HTML / CSS / JS

I'm not a web developper, nor do I endorse web developpment in general.

This is a project I've purely made for fun.

- **images/**: Directory containing image assets.
- **js/script.js**: Contains the JavaScript code for the web application.
- **cv.json**: A JSON file that stores data.
- **index.html**: The main HTML file for the web application.
